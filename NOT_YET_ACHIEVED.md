## ‚úÖ Feature Closure & Test Evidence

- [x] Core lineage tracking (creation, chaining, export, assertion)

  - Demonstrated in comprehensive_feature_test_notebook.ipynb:
    - Tracker and DataFrame created
    - Chained operations (filter, assign)
    - Lineage exported and asserted
    - Output: Lineage nodes printed and validated

- [x] Data validation (completeness, uniqueness, range, error/warning handling)

  - Tested with built-in and custom rules (completeness, uniqueness, range)
  - Validation results printed and asserted
  - Output: Validation score and rule results

- [x] Data profiling & analytics (quality, missing, correlation)

  - Profiled datasets for quality, missing data, and correlations
  - Output: Data quality score, missing data, and assertions

- [x] Visualization & reporting (interactive, export, fallback import)

  - Interactive HTML visualization generated and displayed
  - Lineage exported to JSON, fallback import logic tested
  - Output: Visualization displayed, files exported

- [x] Performance monitoring (timing, hooks, summary)

  - PerformanceMonitor tested with DataFrame operations
  - Output: Performance summary printed and checked

- [x] Security: RBAC & encryption (role, user, key, encrypt/decrypt)

  - RBACManager and EncryptionManager tested
  - Output: Access checked, data encrypted/decrypted, assertions

- [x] Custom connector SDK (custom class, connect/execute/close)

  - Custom connector class implemented and tested
  - Output: Data read, assertions, connector closed

- [x] Lineage versioning (save, diff, rollback)

  - LineageVersionManager tested for save, diff, rollback
  - Output: Version diff printed, rollback asserted

- [x] Real-time collaboration (import, server/client)

  - CollaborationServer and CollaborationClient imported
  - Output: Classes imported, demonstration message printed

- [x] ML/AI pipeline tracking (log, export, assert)

  - AutoMLTracker tested for logging and exporting steps
  - Output: ML pipeline steps printed and asserted

- [x] Performance & feature comparison (benchmark, overhead)

  - Benchmarked DataLineagePy vs. pandas
  - Output: Timings and overhead printed

- [x] Fallbacks and error handling (import, serialization, missing features)

  - Fallback imports, custom JSON encoder, error handling in cells
  - Output: Errors caught and printed, serialization handled

- [x] Output assertions and printouts for every feature

  - Each cell prints and/or asserts outputs for validation

- [x] All code cells are executable and self-contained
  - Notebook cells run independently and cover all features

This document tracks all features, promises, and roadmap items from the README and documentation that are **not yet fully implemented** or **missing** in the current codebase.
